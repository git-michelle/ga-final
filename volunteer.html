        <p class="p-style">
          With the number of projects we run throughout the year, we rely on the
          amazing work that our dedicated and enthusiastic core of volunteers
          provide to help Gift Angels Foundation’s overall mission to assist the
          youth of Uganda.
        </p>
        <p class="p-style">
          By volunteering with us, not only do you make a huge difference in the
          lives of children and their families in Uganda, but you help us learn
          how to continue to grow as a non-profit organization and we appreciate
          everyone that gives their time to support our mission!
        </p>
        <p class="p-style">
          As a volunteer, you will be supporting Gift Angels Foundation’s
          mission through a range of projects, such as, fundraising programs,
          awareness campaigns, marketing campaigns, and assisting in
          administrative tasks. All the volunteer work that is completed allows
          for Gift Angels Foundation to have the necessary tools to continue to
          push and fight against the issues at hand.
