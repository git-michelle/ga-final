          Gift Angels Foundation is a non-profit organization with a focus on
          providing necessary services for various underserved communities in
          Uganda.
        </p>
        <p class="p-style">
          As an organization based in Uganda, we have witnessed the issues that
          underserved communities face on a day to day basis. We aim to cover
          education, agriculture, and health issues, specifically HIV-positive
          individuals, through community development programs and informational
          sessions.

              We are on a mission to address the critical situations that the
              Karamojong youth are facing. The youth in the Karamoja region are
              susceptible to domestic violence, child marriages, and life on the
              streets due to the lack of education and poverty. We aim to
              provide those services and raise awareness on the critical issues
              at hand in this region of Uganda.

              We want to completely bridge the gap between young women and an
              enhanced quality of life through socio-economic opportunities.
              This has led to our Mothers of Gold initiative, where we empower
              young women, living in the Ngora district, through agricultural
              education!
