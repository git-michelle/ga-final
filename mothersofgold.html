        <p class="p-style">
          A long time ago in traditional African societies, young ladies were
          educated on the ways of the world by their aunties. Aunties taught
          young girls proper hygiene, how to prepare meals for their families,
          and how to clean a home. The Mothers of Gold program operates in the
          spirit of these aunties, geared toward empowering women in Ngora by
          bringing wisdom and progressive ideals to young women in this
          fast-changing society.
        </p>
        <p class="p-style">
          In the villages within this district, many women deal with teen
          pregnancies which causes them to drop out of school and ultimately
          struggle to support themselves and their children. Many of these women independently run their households without the support of a partner. Mothers of Gold strives to empower young women through socio-economic support programs that improve their quality of life and in turn, they help to continue community development.

            income-generating activities.

          The Ngora region of Uganda is rich with beauty and resources, but its
          people are greatly affected by poverty. A staggering 80% of the
          population lives below the poverty line. We believe that by investing
          in educational and awareness initiatives, we can combat this rampant
          poverty, and improve the lives of the locals there. In particular, we
          aim to empower the many hard-working female breadwinners.
        </p>
        <p class="p-style">
          For agriculturalists, Ngora is one of the most fertile places for
          farming, and a lot of non-residents buy land to set up farms and
          gardens. Our goal is to equip the women in Ngora with the knowledge
          and skills to generate income and improve their financial standing. We
          do this through business skills training, financial management
          workshops, and establishing the foundation for poultry farming in
          order to step closer to kicking poverty out of Ngora.

          The Mothers of Gold Awareness and Sensitization program aims to

          health, and basic financial management.

          This project’s main goal is to improve the welfare of young women in the Ngora district. It is their strength and

          assessment will be conducted to ensure that we customize the training and workshops to topics that are relevant to them.

          There is a much lower rate of teenage pregnancies in urban areas
          because pre-teens and teenagers are taught about pre-marital sex, HIV,
          and pregnancy prevention methods. We believe that providing an
          outreach program to all schools will have the same impact.
