          Our prayer is that all may come to experience the life of Christ to
          its fullest measure. And we pray for every heart to have the will to
          make it so through Christ Jesus.
        </p>
        <p class="p-style">
          We pray because our faith in God gives us hope that restoration and
          renewal are possible even in the most difficult places. We see hope
          reflected in transformed lives and restored relationships and we have
          evidence that this hope is evident in lives.
        </p>
        <p class="p-style">
          We have fallen in love with God’s Gift Angels Foundation: a glorious
          future for all creation! Our vision lies beyond our reach but we put
          our trust in God. All our hopes and aspirations point to Jesus Christ,
          for it was He who made us believe that nothing is impossible with God.
          In Jesus Christ, the love, mercy, and grace of God are made known to
          us and all people. From this overflowing abundance of God's love, we
          find our call to ministry.
        </p>
        <p class="p-style">
          Gift Angels Foundation seeks to be available for God to work through
          us as His People and friend in making His Will come true. This also is
          our prayer for every staff member, every donor, every community, and
          every organization we partner with: that God’s power will be at work
          in us and do far more than we dare ask or imagine for the sake of
          every child, regardless of religion, race, ethnicity or gender and
          origin.
        </p>
        <p class="p-style">
          Pray with us for the poor, the powerless, the afflicted, the
          oppressed, and the marginalized. Pray for hope and dignity for all
          women and children. Pray for unjust attitudes and systems to be
          challenged and for resources to be shared. Pray for love for all
          people without discrimination or conditions. Pray for peace - within
          homes, communities, and nations, with God, with oneself. Pray for hope
          in the face of need and suffering. Pray for a blessing on the efforts
          made by the Gift Angels Foundation team and many others to lighten
          their plight. Pray for life in all its fullness for every child. And
          pray for every heart to have the discretion to make it so. Believe God
          so that His will reign in every child that Gift Angels Foundation team
          pray and work with to the glory of His name.
