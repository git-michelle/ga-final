                Our prayer is that all may come to experience the life of Christ to
                its fullest measure. And we pray for every heart to have the will to
                make it so through Christ Jesus.
            </p>
            <p class="p-style">
                We pray because our faith in God gives us hope that restoration and
                renewal are possible even in the most difficult places. We see hope
                reflected in transformed lives and restored relationships and we have
                evidence that this hope is evident in lives.
            </p>
            <p class="p-style">
                We have fallen in love with God’s Gift Angels Foundation: a glorious
                future for all creation! Our vision lies beyond our reach but we put
                our trust in God. All our hopes and aspirations point to Jesus Christ,
                for it was He who made us believe that nothing is impossible with God.
                In Jesus Christ, the love, mercy, and grace of God are made known to
                us and all people. From this overflowing abundance of God's love, we
                find our call to ministry.
            </p>
            <p class="p-style">
                Gift Angels Foundation seeks to be available for God to work through
                us as His People and friend in making His Will come true. This also is
                our prayer for every staff member, every donor, every community, and
                every organization we partner with: that God’s power will be at work
                in us and do far more than we dare ask or imagine for the sake of
                every child, regardless of religion, race, ethnicity or gender and
                origin.
            </p>
            <p class="p-style">
                Pray with us for the poor, the powerless, the afflicted, the
                oppressed, and the marginalized. Pray for hope and dignity for all
                women and children. Pray for unjust attitudes and systems to be
                challenged and for resources to be shared. Pray for love for all
                people without discrimination or conditions. Pray for peace - within
                homes, communities, and nations, with God, with oneself. Pray for hope
                in the face of need and suffering. Pray for a blessing on the efforts
                made by the Gift Angels Foundation team and many others to lighten
                their plight. Pray for life in all its fullness for every child. And
                pray for every heart to have the discretion to make it so. Believe God
                so that His will reign in every child that Gift Angels Foundation team
                pray and work with to the glory of His name.
