          Gift Angels Foundation is a non-profit organization, with a focus on
          providing necessary services for the affected communities in Uganda.
          The organization was founded in March 2015 by four co-founders;
          Richard, Violet, Peter, and Michael, who are all currently involved in
          Gift Angels Foundation as active directors.
        </p>
        <p class="p-style">
          With their collective shared backgrounds in business administration,
          hospitality, concept development, global development issues, and
          sustainability, they are leading Gift Angels Foundation's initiatives
          towards building a stronger community within the regions of Uganda.

          Community development is crucially needed in Uganda and we believe
          through educational efforts and direct community engagement, the
          communities will change positively.

        <p class="p-style">
          We strive to provide the youths within the Ugandan communities access
          to basic education, developmental programs for generating income, and
          informational campaigns to raise awareness on overall health and
          sexual/reproductive health, especially for HIV-positive individuals.

          At Gift Angels Foundation, we believe in utilizing all the tools at

          focus on one specific development issue. This has allowed us to
          develop an ongoing and continuously updated list of objectives for our
          initiatives:
