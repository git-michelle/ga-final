        <p class="p-style">
          We are a community-focused organization. We derive our knowledge and
          understanding from the spirit of the Almighty Lord to serve the
          community just as Christ surrendered everything for humankind. In the
          same way, we are conformed to His vision of His community. Therefore,
          we strive to bring life to all communities so that every individual
          can enjoy life in its fullness through Christ.

          It takes God to end violence against every child in a country.
        </p>
        <p class="p-style">
          1.7 Billion children are affected by violence each year. Violence,
          whether physical, sexual, or psychological, can have an enormously
          detrimental impact on children and often affects their well-being for
          years to come. That is why at Gift Angels Foundation we are relentless
          advocates for supporting victims of violence, and investing in
          educational programs to end the cycle. All children have the right to
          live in a community free of violence.
        </p>
        <p class="p-style">
          We invite individuals, groups, and organizations that share the same
          Christian vision to join Gift Angels Foundation to spread salvation to
          the world.
