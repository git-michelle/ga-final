        <h2>Every Little Bit Counts</h2>
        <p class="p-style">
          Uganda is one of the poorest countries on the African continent and in
          the world. A fourth of the world’s malnourished children currently
          live in Uganda and the long-term damages that the children endure due
          to this environment are irreversible, from contracting infections to
          leading a life that results in a higher mortality rate.
        </p>
        <p class="p-style">
          With your support, we at Gift Angels Foundation, will be able to
          provide the necessary services and items to fight against the
          malnourishment problem in Uganda’s youth. Donation funds are used to
          provide Uganda’s youth with necessities, such as food, shelter,
          medical care, and access to education.
        </p>
        <p class="p-style">
          We at Gift Angels strive to be completely transparent with all donors
          on where and how donated funds are used. We believe every child
          deserves a safe and nurturing environment as they grow, but sadly, in
          Uganda, the harsh environment doesn’t allow for safety or nourishment.
          We appreciate and thank all donors. Please know your contribution
          makes a difference in someone’s life and brings us closer to our
          goals.

            <p>
              Due to the issue of malnourishment in Uganda, your support will
              allow us to provide the proper health education and necessities,
              such as food and water

            <p>
              We aim to provide educational services from health education, to
              prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS, to reduce the level of illiteracy
              for the youth through the basic needs of an educational system.

            </div>
            <p>
              The risk of contracting HIV/AIDS within the underserved Uganda
              communities is quite high. We plan to fight the risk by providing
              awareness campaigns and necessary medical supplies to fight the
              disease.

            <p>
              Water and sanitation are essential needs for all living beings,
              but in Uganda, poor hygiene education has left many children at
              risk of getting ill. We want to change the way children access
              drinking water and provide the proper education on
              hygiene/sanitation.

            </div>
            <p>
              Within Uganda, agriculture is the source of providing income to
              support oneself and their families. With your help, quality crops
              will be purchased to meet the basic needs of poverty-stricken
              individuals.

            <p>
              Poverty-stricken communities in Uganda face receiving the basic
              needs needed to live a healthy life. Your contribution will help
              in developing sanitation, health, infrastructure development,
